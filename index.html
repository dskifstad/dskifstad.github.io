I'm a senior Mechanical Engineering major taking this web design and development course to broaden my horizons. While, as a CMU student, I have focused the majority of the past four years on my studies, I have been able to maintain some of my fondest hobbies. First and foremost, I am an avid soccer player and supporter. I regularly follow the English Premier League, since American soccer sucks. Honestly, I sort of follow a lot of the big European teams, but I definitely spend the majority of my time and effort supporing Liverpool Football Club.		</p>		<p class="center-text">			That said, I do have a couple other less significant hobbies. I'm not sure I can say that I really, highly enjoy lifting outright, but it's great for helping me stay healthy and grounded amongst the chaos that is CMU. I also like playing some Xbox from time to time. This is a great study break (and also procrastination tool) that allows me to step away for a while and enjoy myself. Lastly, another hobby that I really discovered during my time here is my love for attending live music. Whether it's rock, rap, or EDM, live music is a great experience that I hope to continue pursuing throughout my early adulthood at the very least.		</p>		<br/>			<figure>				<img class ="img-1" src="images/soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer" title="I Like Soccer" />				<p>					<figcaption>						This is a random picture of people playing soccer I got off the internet.
